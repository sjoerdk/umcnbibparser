  abstract     = {Driven by the continuous improvement in the accuracy of cross-sectional imaging, image-guided minimally invasive local ablative therapies have received incremental interest over the past few years. In this article, we systematically review the currently available literature on F-FDG PET/CT to monitor the efficacy of these local ablative therapies. By including all local ablative treatment modalities, tumor types, and organ sites, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current status, identify general patterns across studies, and provide recommendations for future studies and clinical practice. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) criteria were used to assess the quality of the reported diagnostic accuracy of the retrieved studies. Data in the literature suggest that F-FDG PET/CT is a highly accurate tool to assess the technical success of local treatment, to identify residual or recurrent tumor early after intervention, and to provide prognostic and predictive information. However, prospective interventional studies based on F-FDG PET/CT findings of disease activity are mandatory to develop uniform and quantitative criteria for PET evaluation. Moreover, the optimal timing of F-FDG PET/CT after treatment may vary according to the location of the disease, with very early imaging being possible in solid organs such as the liver but posttreatment imaging being challenging for 3 mo in a location such as the lung parenchyma.},

  abstract     = {This review focuses on developments in muscle ultrasound as a noninvasive and accurate tool for the diagnosis and follow-up of neuromuscular disease. It discusses current muscle ultrasound applications with already proven clinical value, and highlights recent technical developments that may further advance muscle ultrasounds' diagnostic qualities. The sensitivity and specificity of muscle ultrasound for detecting a neuromuscular disorder are high (90-95%), and quantitative ultrasound is well suited to monitor disease progression in several disorders. Adding ultrasound to electromyography significantly improves diagnostic certainty in patients with suspected motor neuron disease, and ultrasound increases the detection of fasciculations with 30-50%. New developments include speckle tracking of tissue motion to quantify diaphragm excursions and diminished muscle contractility in dystrophy, and strain elastography to detect changes in muscle stiffness and anisotropy during contraction and in disease states. Deep learning algorithms are being developed to predict the presence of a muscle disease and differentiate between disorders. Muscle ultrasound is excellent for screening, diagnosing, and follow-up of neuromuscular disease. New developments are underway to automate and objectify the diagnostic process, and to quantify tissue motion that can provide new insights in pathophysiology and serve as a biomarker.},

  abstract       = {Affibody molecules (6-7Ã¢â‚¬â€°kDa) are a new class of small robust three-helical scaffold proteins. Radiolabeled subnanomolar anti-HER2 affibody ZHER2:342 was developed for imaging of HER2 expression in tumors, and a clinical study has demonstrated that the (111)In- and (68)Ga-labeled affibody molecules can efficiently detect HER2 expressing metastases in breast cancer patients. However, a significant renal accumulation of radioactivity after systemic injection of a radiolabeled anti-HER2 affibody conjugate is observed. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of renal reabsorption of anti-HER2 affibody at the molecular level. Renal accumulation of radiolabeled anti-HER2 affibody molecules was studied in a murine model and in vitro using opossum-derived proximal tubule (OK) cells. It was found that kidney reabsorption of affibody molecule was not driven by megalin/cubilin. Amino acids in the target-binding side of affibody molecule were involved in binding to OK cells. On OK cells, two types of receptors for anti-HER2 affibody molecule were found: KD1=0.8Ã¢â‚¬â€°nM, Bmax1=71,500 and KD2=9.2Ã¢â‚¬â€°nM, Bmax2=367,000. The results of the present study indicate that affibody molecule and other scaffold-based targeting proteins with a relatively low kidney uptake can be selected using in vitro studies with tubular kidney cells.},

This multivariate analysis was undertaken to evaluate the potential role of the standard uptake value (SUV) in predicting disease-free and overall survival in melanoma patients with lymph node metastases.All melanoma patients with palpable lymph node metastases who where referred for a fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan were eligible. The SUV in the lymph node metastasis was calculated. Data were analyzed (Kaplan-Meier), and differences in cumulative survival and the disease-free rate were assessed (log-rank test). Univariate and multivariate analyses (Cox proportional hazard model) were performed to determine independent prognostic factors.There was no statistical difference in survival for the 38 patients with a high or low SUVmean (P = .11). However, a significant difference was found in disease-free survival (P = .03). Ulceration of the primary melanoma (P = .023) was an independent predictor of survival. For the disease-free survival, multivariate Cox regression showed adjuvant radiation (P = .001), localization of the primary melanoma (P = .017), and a high SUVmean (P = .009) as independent prognostic factors.Disease-free survival of melanoma patients was prolonged in those with a low SUVmean value (P = .03) in their lymph node metastasis, as compared with those with a high SUVmean. However, this difference was not found for overall survival. In multivariate analysis, high SUVmean was an independent prognostic factor (P = .009) for disease-free survival. Prospective research should determine whether patients with a high FDG uptake in melanoma lymph node metastases could benefit from adjuvant radiation treatment or chemotherapy.},

Ten consecutive patients with histopathologically proved recurrent prostate cancer after radiation therapy, without evidence of distant metastases, were treated while under general anesthesia in a 1.5-T MR unit. A urethral warmer was inserted. Cryoneedles were transperineally inserted under real-time MR imaging. Then, a rectal warmer was inserted. Ice ball growth was continuously monitored under MR imaging guidance. Two freeze-thaw cycles were performed. Follow-up consisted of a visit to the urologist, measurement of prostate-specific antigen level, and multiparametric MR imaging at 3, 6, and 12 months. Potential complications were recorded.Results:All patients were successfully treated. In one patient, the urethral warmer could not be inserted and the procedure was cancelled. Two months later, the procedure was successfully repeated. Another patient had urinary retention. Follow-up data were available for all patients. A local recurrence or remnant tumor was found in two patients after 6 months and in another patient after 12 months. These three patients underwent successful retreatment with MR imaging-guided focal cryoablation.Conclusion:MR imaging-guided focal cryoablation of recurrent prostate cancer after radiation therapy is feasible and safe. Initial results are promising; however, longer follow-up is needed and more patients must be studied.Ã‚Â© RSNA, 2013.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE:
The purpose of this study was to develop a realistic patient-based 4D digital breast phantom including time-varying contrast enhancement for simulation of dedicated breast CT perfusion imaging.

METHODS:
A 3D static phantom is first created by segmenting a breast CT image from a healthy patient into skin, fibroglandular tissue, adipose tissue, and vasculature. For the creation of abnormal cases, a breast lesion model was developed and can be added to the phantom. After defining the necessary perfusion parameters for each tissue (e.g., arterial input function for vasculature, blood volume and blood flow for the other normal tissues) based on contrast-enhanced dynamic breast MRI data, the corresponding time-enhancement curves are computed for each voxel in the phantom, according to tissue type. These curves are calculated by convolution between the arterial input function and a shifted exponential function. This exponential depends on the perfusion parameters associated with each tissue voxel, and, to incorporate normal biological variability, a uniform random distribution is used to vary the perfusion parameters on a voxel-basis. Finally, a 4D array is produced by sampling the continuous time-enhancement curves at the desired sampling rate. Beside modeling different enhancement dynamics according to the given input perfusion parameters, the phantom also includes the possibility to realistically simulate different spatial enhancement patterns for the breast parenchyma, taking into account the arterial sources supplying the breast. Finally, different patterns of contrast medium uptake can also be simulated for the tumor models (homogeneous and rim enhancement).

RESULTS:
As an example, a typical 4D phantom has dimensions of 426 × 421 × 260 × 559 (x, y, z, t), with a voxel size of 273 μm and a sampling time of 1 s. The characteristics of the tumor model can be modified at will to evaluate perfusion in different types of breast lesions. Results show the expected enhancement of tissues, consistent with the given input parameters. Moreover, the tumor models evaluated in this work show different enhancement dynamics according to the tumor type (defined by different input perfusion parameters), and also present a higher enhancement compared to the other healthy tissues, as expected.

CONCLUSIONS:
The proposed digital phantom can model the breast tissue perfusion during 4D breast CT image acquisition, displaying the different enhancement dynamics that could be found in a real patient breast. This phantom can be used during the development of dynamic contrast-enhanced dedicated breast CT imaging, for optimization of image acquisition, image reconstruction, and image analysis. This modality could provide functional information of the breast, resulting in detection, diagnosis, and treatment improvements of breast cancer with breast CT.},

Due to the restricted expression of alpha(v)beta(3) in tumours, alpha(v)beta(3) is considered a suitable receptor for tumour targeting. In this study the alpha(v)beta(3) binding characteristics of an (111)In-labelled monomeric, dimeric and tetrameric RGD analogue were compared.A monomeric (E-c(RGDfK)), dimeric (E-[c(RGDfK)](2)), and tetrameric (E{E[c(RGDfK)](2)}(2)) RGD peptide were synthesised, conjugated with DOTA and radiolabelled with (111)In. In vitro alpha(v)beta(3) binding characteristics were determined in a competitive binding assay. In vivo alpha(v)beta(3) targeting characteristics of the compounds were assessed in mice with SK-RC-52 xenografts.The IC(50) values for DOTA-E-c(RGDfK), DOTA-E-[c(RGDfK)](2), and DOTA-E{E[c(RGDfK)](2)}(2)were 120 nM, 69.9 nM and 19.6 nM, respectively. At all time points, the tumour uptake of the dimer was significantly higher as compared to that of the monomer. At 8 h p.i., tumour uptake of the tetramer (7.40+/-1.12\%ID/g) was significantly higher than that of the monomer (2.30+/-0.34\%ID/g), p<0.001, and the dimer (5.17+/-1.22\%ID/g), p<0.05. At 24 h p.i., the tumour uptake was significantly higher for the tetramer (6.82+/-1.41\%ID/g) than for the dimer (4.22+/-0.96\%ID/g), p<0.01, and the monomer (1.90+/-0.29\%ID/g), p<0.001.Multimerisation of c(RGDfK) resulted in enhanced affinity for alpha(v)beta(3) as determined in vitro. Tumour uptake of a tetrameric RGD peptide was significantly higher than that of the monomeric and dimeric analogues, presumably owing to the enhanced statistical likelihood for rebinding to alpha(v)beta(3).},

  abstract       = {Angiogenesis is a multistep process regulated by pro- and antiangiogenic factors. In order to grow and metastasize, tumors need a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients. For growth beyond 1-2 mm in size, tumors are dependent on angiogenesis. Inhibition of angiogenesis is a new cancer treatment strategy that is now widely investigated clinically. Researchers have begun to search for objective measures that indicate pharmacologic responses to antiangiogenic drugs. Therefore, there is a great interest in techniques to visualize angiogenesis in growing tumors noninvasively. Several markers have been described that are preferentially expressed on newly formed blood vessels in tumors (alpha(v)beta(3) integrin, vascular endothelial growth factor, and its receptor, prostate-specific membrane antigen) and in the extracellular matrix surrounding newly formed blood vessels (extra domain B of fibronectin, Tenascin-C, matrix metalloproteinases, and Robo-4). Several ligands targeting these markers have been tested as a radiotracer for imaging angiogenesis in tumors. The potential of some of these tracers, such as radiolabeled cyclic RGD peptides and radiolabeled anti-PSMA antibodies, has already been tested in cancer patients, while for markers such as Robo-4, the ligand has not yet been identified. In this review, an overview on the currently used nuclear imaging probes for noninvasive visualization of tumor angiogenesis is given.},

  abstract        = {Overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is linked to an adverse outcome in various solid tumors. Cetuximab is an EGFR inhibitor, which in combination with radiotherapy improves locoregional control and survival in a subgroup of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). The aim of this study was to develop and characterize an EGFR-directed PET tracer, (64) Cu-cetuximab-F(ab')2, to determine the systemic accessibility of EGFR. Mice with HNSCC xenografts, UT-SCC-8 (n = 6) or UT-SCC-45 (n = 6), were imaged 24 h post injection with (64) Cu-NODAGA-cetuximab-F(ab')2 using PET/CT. One mouse for each tumor model was co-injected with excess unlabeled cetuximab 3 days before radiotracer injection to determine non-EGFR-mediated uptake. Ex vivo biodistribution of the tracer was determined and tumors were analyzed by autoradiography and immunohistochemistry. The SUVmax of UT-SCC-8 tumors was higher than that of UT-SCC-45: 1.5 ± 1.0 and 0.8 ± 0.2 (p < 0.05), respectively. SUVmax after in vivo blocking of EGFR with cetuximab was 0.4. Immunohistochemistry showed that UT-SCC-8 had a significantly higher EGFR expression than UT-SCC-45: 0.50 ± 0.19 versus 0.12 ± 0.08 (p < 0.005), respectively. Autoradiography indicated that (64) Cu-cetuximab-F(ab')2 uptake correlated with EGFR expression in both tumors: r = 0.86 ± 0.06 (UT-SCC-8) and 0.90 ± 0.06 (UT-SCC-45). (64) Cu-cetuximab-F(ab')2 is a promising PET tracer to determine expression of EGFR in vivo. Clinically, this tracer has the potential to be used to determine cetuximab targeting of tumors and possibly to non-invasively monitor the response to EGFR-inhibitor treatment.},

  abstract       = {The integration of positron emission tomography (PET) information for target volume delineation in radiation treatment planning is routine in many centers. In contrast to automatic contouring, research on visual-manual delineation is scarce. The present study investigates the dependency of manual delineation on experience and qualification.A total of 44 international interdisciplinary observers each defined a [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET based gross tumor volume (GTV) using the same PET/CT scan from a patient with lung cancer. The observers were "experts" (E; nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3), "experienced interdisciplinary pairs" (EP; 9 teams of radiation oncologist (RO) + nuclear medicine physician (NP)), "single field specialists" (SFS; nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°13), and "students" (S; nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°10). Five automatic delineation methods (AM) were also included. Volume sizes and concordance indices within the groups (pCI) and relative to the experts (eCI) were calculated.E (pCI =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.67) and EP (pCI =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.53) showed a significantly higher agreement within the groups as compared to SFS (pCI =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.43, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.03, and pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.006). In relation to the experts, EP (eCI =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.55) showed better concordance compared to SFS (eCI =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.49) or S (eCI =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.47). The intermethod variability of the AM (pCI =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.44) was similar to that of SFS and S, showing poorer agreement with the experts (eCI =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.35).The results suggest that interdisciplinary cooperation could be beneficial for consistent contouring. Joint delineation by a radiation oncologist and a nuclear medicine physician showed remarkable agreement and better concordance with the experts compared to other specialists. The relevant intermethod variability of the automatic algorithms underlines the need for further standardization and optimization in this field.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE:
To validate Monte Carlo (MC)-based breast dosimetry estimations using both a homogeneous and a 3D anthropomorphic breast phantom under polyenergetic irradiation for internal breast dosimetry purposes.

METHODS:
Experimental measurements were performed with a clinical digital mammography system (Mammomat Inspiration, Siemens Healthcare), using the x-ray spectrum selected by the automatic exposure control and a tube current-exposure time product of 360 mAs. A homogeneous 50% glandular breast phantom and a 3D anthropomorphic breast phantom were used to investigate the dose at different depths (range 0-4 cm with 1 cm steps) for the homogeneous case and at a depth of 2.25 cm for the anthropomorphic case. Local dose deposition was measured using thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD), metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor dosimeters (MOSFET), and GafChromic™ films. A Geant4-based MC simulation was modified to match the clinical experimental setup. Thirty sensitive volumes (3.2 × 3.2 × 0.38 mm3 ) on the axial-phantom plane were included at each depth in the simulation to characterize the internal dose variation and compare it to the experimental TLD and MOSFET measurements. The experimental 2D dose maps obtained with the GafChromic™ films were compared to the simulated 2D dose distributions.

RESULTS:
Due to the energy dependence of the dosimeters and due to x-ray beam hardening, dosimeters based on these three technologies have to be calibrated at each depth of the phantom. As expected, the dose was found to decrease with increasing phantom depth, with the reduction being ~93% after 4 cm for the homogeneous breast phantom. The 2D dose map showed nonuniformities in the dose distribution in the axial plane of the phantom. The mean combined standard uncertainty increased with phantom depth by up to 5.3% for TLD, 6.3% for MOSFET, and 9.6% for GafChromic™ film. In the case of a heterogeneous phantom, the dosimeters are able to detect local dose gradient variations. In particular, GafChromic™ film showed local dose variations of about 46% at the boundaries of two materials.

CONCLUSIONS:
Results showed a good agreement between experimental measurements (with TLD and MOSFET) and MC data for both homogeneous and anthropomorphic breast phantoms. Larger discrepancies are found when comparing the GafChromic™ dose values to the MC results due to the inherent less precise nature of the former. MC validations in a heterogeneous background at the level of local dose deposition and in absolute terms play a fundamental role in the development of an accurate method to estimate radiation dose. The potential introduction of a breast dosimetry model involving a nonhomogeneous glandular/adipose tissue composition makes the validation of internal dose distributions estimates crucial.},

Whereas directly-labeled antibodies, fragments, and subfragments (minibodies and other constructs) have shown promise in both imaging and therapy applications over the past 25 years, their clinical adoption has not fulfilled the original expectations due to either poor image resolution and contrast in scanning or insufficient radiation doses delivered selectively to tumors for therapy. Pretargeting involves the separation of the localization of tumor with an anticancer antibody from the subsequent delivery of the imaging or therapeutic radionuclide. This has shown improvements in both imaging and therapy by overcoming the limitations of conventional, or 1-step, radioimmunodetection or radioimmunotherapy. We focus herein on the use of bispecific antibodies followed by radiolabeled peptide haptens as a new modality of selective delivery of radionuclides for the imaging and therapy of cancer. Our particular emphasis in pretargeting is the use of bispecific trimeric (3 Fab's) recombinant constructs made by a modular method of antibody and protein engineering of fusion molecules called Dock and Lock (DNL).},

As gastrin-binding CCK(2) receptors are also expressed on a variety of other neuroendocrine tumours (NET), we compared GRS to somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) in patients with NET. SRS and GRS were performed within 21 days in a series of 60 consecutive patients with NET. GRS was directly compared with SRS. If lesions were visible on GRS but not detectable by SRS, other imaging modalities (MRI, CT) and follow-up were used for verification. Of the 60 evaluable patients, 51 had carcinoid tumours, 3 gastrinomas, 2 glucagonomas, 1 insulinoma and 3 paragangliomas. The overall tumour-detection rate was 73.7\% for GRS and 82.1\% for SRS. In the 11 patients with negative SRS, GRS was positive in 6 (54.5\%). Based on the number of tumour sites detected and the degree of uptake, GRS performed better than SRS in 13 patients (21.7\%), equivalent images were obtained in 18 cases (30.0\%) and SRS performed better in 24 (40.0\%) cases. In six of the SRS positive patients, 18 additional sites of tumour involvement could be detected. Overall, GRS detected additional tumour sites in 20\% of the patients. Localisation of the primary tumours or their functional status had no influence on the outcome of imaging. GRS should be performed in selected patients as it may provide additional information in patients with NET with equivocal or absent somatostatin uptake.},

Resonances of nine phosphate metabolites were identified in the spectra and metabolite concentrations were estimated from the corresponding integrals ([ATP] = 3.4 +/- 0.7 mM). Tissue pH, as deduced from the chemical shift of the inorganic phosphate resonance, was 7.26 (+/- 0.07). T1 relaxation times of ATP, phosphocreatine, inorganic phosphate, and phosphomonoester 31P spin systems were examined. The effect of hypoxia was followed as a function of time. 31P NMR spectra of the glands have also been obtained noninvasively by the use of a surface coil, adapted to the dimensions of the glands, and depth pulses.},

Tissue dimensions were measured using calipers. Echo levels were calibrated and were corrected for beam characteristics, gel path, and tissue attenuation using a tissue-mimicking phantom.At the central position of the philtrum, mean thickness (SD) of lip loose connective tissue layer, orbicularis oris muscle, and dense connective layer was 4.0 (0.1) mm, 2.3 (0.7) mm, and 2.2 (0.7) mm, respectively, in healthy lip at rest; and 4.1 (0.9) mm, 3.8 (1.7) mm, and 2.6 (0.6) mm, respectively, in contracted lip. Mean (SD) echo level of muscle and dense connective tissue layer with respect to echo level of lip loose connective tissue layer was -19.3 (0.6) dB and -10.7 (4.0) dB, respectively, in relaxed condition and -20.7 (1.5) dB and -7.7 (2.3) dB, respectively, in contracted state. Color mode echo images were calculated, showing lip tissues in separate colors and highlighting details like discontinuity of the orbicularis oris muscle and presence of scar tissue.Quantitative assessment of thickness and echo level of various lip tissues is feasible after proper echographic equipment calibration. Diagnostic potentials of this method for noninvasive evaluation of cleft lip reconstruction outcome are promising.},

Mean maximum standardized uptake values for the hottest voxel in the tumor and its 8 surrounding voxels in 1 transversal slice (SUVmax(9)) of the PET scans were calculated, as well as PET-segmented gross tumor volumes using visual delineation (GTVVIS) and operator-independent methods based on signal-to-background ratio (GTVSBR) and 50\% isocontour of the maximum signal intensity (GTV50\%). PET parameters were evaluated for correlations with outcome.(18)F-FLT uptake decreased significantly between consecutive scans. An SUVmax(9) decline Ã¢â€°Â¥ 45\% and a GTVVIS decrease Ã¢â€°Â¥ median during the first 2 treatment weeks were associated with better 3-y disease-free survival (88\% vs. 63\%, P = 0.035, and 91\% vs. 65\%, P = 0.037, respectively). A GTVVIS decrease Ã¢â€°Â¥ median in the fourth treatment week was also associated with better 3-y locoregional control (100\% vs. 68\%, P = 0.021). These correlations were most prominent in the subset of patients treated with chemoradiotherapy. Because of low (18)F-FLT uptake levels during treatment, GTVSBR and GTV50\% were unsuccessful in segmenting primary tumor volume.In head and neck cancer, a change in (18)F-FLT uptake early during radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy is a strong indicator for long-term outcome. (18)F-FLT PET may thus aid in personalized patient management by steering treatment modifications during an early phase of therapy.},

  abstract       = {Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is an important regulator of arterial blood pressure. The mechanisms mediating its hypotensive effects are complex and involve the inhibition of the sympathetic and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) systems, increased diuresis/natriuresis, vasodilation, and enhanced vascular permeability. In particular, the contribution of the direct vasodilating effect of ANP to the hypotensive actions remains controversial, because variable levels of the ANP receptor, guanylyl cyclase A (GC-A), are expressed in different vascular beds. The objective of our study was to determine whether a selective deletion of GC-A in vascular smooth muscle would affect the hypotensive actions of ANP. We first created a mutant allele of mouse GC-A by flanking a required exon with loxP sequences. Crossing floxed GC-A with SM22-Cre transgene mice expressing Cre recombinase in smooth muscle cells (SMC) resulted in mice in which vascular GC-A mRNA expression was reduced by approximately 80\%. Accordingly, the relaxing effects of ANP on isolated vessels from these mice were abolished; despite this fact, chronic arterial blood pressure of awake SMC GC-A KO mice was normal. Infusion of ANP caused immediate decreases in blood pressure in floxed GC-A but not in SMC GC-A knockout mice. Furthermore, acute vascular volume expansion, which causes release of cardiac ANP, did not affect resting blood pressure of floxed GC-A mice, but rapidly and significantly increased blood pressure of SMC GC-A knockout mice. We conclude that vascular GC-A is dispensable in the chronic and critical in the acute moderation of arterial blood pressure by ANP.},

  abstract    = {The best known method of high-intensity focused ultrasound is thermal ablation, but interest in non-thermal, mechanical destruction is increasing. The advantages of mechanical ablation are that thermal protein denaturation remains limited and less damage is created to the surrounding tissue by thermal diffusion. The two main techniques for mechanical fragmentation of tissue are histotripsy and boiling histotripsy. These techniques can be used for complete liquefaction of tumor tissue into submicron fragments, after which the fragmented tissue can be easily removed by natural (immunologic) responses. Interestingly it seems that there is a correlation between the degree of destruction and tissue specific characteristics based on the treatment settings used. In this review article, the technical aspects of these two techniques are described, and an overview of the in vivo pathologic and immunologic responses is provided.},

This additional third phase in PCr hydrolysis, is preceded by a common biphasic pattern (first fast then slow) in PCr use. The NMR spectra, as localized by a surface coil and improved by proton irradiation, were collected at a time resolution of 16 s. Mean rates of PCr hydrolysis during exercise were -0.44 +/- 0.19\% s(-1), -0.07 +/- 0.04\% s(-1), and -0.29 +/- 0.10\% s(-1) for the three successive phases.

  abstract       = {Decreased prostatic compliance as a result of benign prostatic enlargement can result in bladder outlet obstruction. This changes the urethral pressure profile during voiding. In this study, the authors propose noninvasive estimation of this pressure profile. In four soft tissue mimicking models of the urethra with increasing degree of obstruction, the authors measured deformation of the wall during flow, using ultrasound imaging. Combined with estimates of the model compliance, the authors were able to estimate the pressure profile.First, the compliances (Young's moduli) of the four models were derived by applying static luminal pressure and measuring the resulting strain of the tissue using an ultrasound imaging system. Next, continuous flow was applied to the models and the strain in the urethral wall was measured similarly. The luminal pressure profile was estimated from the strain (measured under continuous flow conditions) and the derived compliance (measured under static pressure conditions). The estimated pressures up- and downstream of the obstruction were compared with the corresponding measured pressures. In the obstructed region, the strain gradient was estimated using linear regression.The luminal pressure values estimated from the ultrasound data up- and downstream of the obstruction were not significantly different from the corresponding measured pressures. The general pressure profile showed a decrease along the length of the obstruction followed by a small increase after the obstruction. The strain gradient in the obstructed region reflected the decrease in urethral pressure and increased with flow rate and degree of obstruction.The results from this model study illustrate the feasibility of noninvasive estimation of the urethral pressure profile using ultrasound. This offers the prospect of a noninvasive, ultrasound based diagnostic tool for assessment of bladder outlet obstruction in men with lower urinary tract symptoms.},

The influence of different region of interest (ROI) diameters (6-20 mm) and software techniques (automatic (ROIaut), copied (ROIcop) and fixed coordinate (ROIfix) measurements) on annual rate of change, trend assessment interval (TAI; an estimate of the follow-up time required for measuring a true change), percentage of positioning errors (positioning of the ROI partly at the cortical edge or even partly beyond the calcaneus) and short-term precision error was studied. When using ROI diameters increasing from 8 to 20 mm, the annual rate of change of BUA and SOS did not change in adults, but was higher in prepubertal subjects (when subjects with positioning errors were excluded) as well as in pubertal/adolescent subjects. TAIs for BUA were shortest when using ROIaut with ROI diameters between 8 and 14 mm (TAI between 1.2 and 1.5 years for prepubertal boys and pubertal/adolescent subjects, 2.4 years for prepubertal girls, 2.7 years for postmenopausal women, and 9 years in men and premenopausal women). TAIs for SOS were 4 years or more, except for postmenopausal women (2.1 years) and prepubertal boys (3.2 years). Measurements with large ROI diameters, especially with fixed region coordinates, resulted in a high percentage of positioning errors and mostly in longer TAIs. Analysis of the short-term precision errors did not reveal these important differences between the various ROI diameters. Our results indicate that calcaneal ultrasound imaging may be useful for measuring skeletal changes in healthy children, especially with BUA, and in postmenopausal women with BUA and SOS using an automatic measurement in the region of lowest attenuation. ROI diameters of 12 mm should be used in prepubertal subjects and of 14 mm in pubertal/adolescent and adult subjects.},

  abstract       = {CONTEXT: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are typically overweight and have an increased liver fat content (LFAT). High LFAT may be explained by an increased efflux of free fatty acids from the adipose tissue which is partly instigated by inflammatory changes. This would imply an association between inflammatory features of the adipose tissue and liver fat content. OBJECTIVE: To analyse associations between inflammatory features of the adipose tissue and liver fat content. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. PATIENTS: Twenty-seven obese patients with insulin-treated T2DM were studied. MEASUREMENTS: LFAT content was measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A subcutaneous (sc) fat biopsy was obtained to determine morphology and protein levels within adipose tissue. In addition to fat cell size, the percentage of macrophages and the presence of crown like structures (CLSs) within sc fat was assessed by CD68-immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: Mean LFAT percentage was 11.1 Ã‚Â± 1.7\% (range 0.75-32.9\%); 63\% of the patients were diagnosed with an elevated LFAT (upper range of normal Ã¢â€°Â¤ 5.5\%). Whereas adipocyte size did not correlate with LFAT, 3 out of 4 subjects with CLSs in sc fat had elevated LFAT and the percentage of macrophages present in sc adipose tissue was positively associated with LFAT. Protein concentrations of adiponectin within adipose tissue negatively correlated with LFAT. Adipose tissue protein levels of the key inflammatory adipokine plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) were positively associated with LFAT. CONCLUSIONS: Several pro-inflammatory changes in sc adipose tissue associate with increased LFAT content in obese insulin-treated patients with T2DM. These findings suggest that inflammatory changes at the level of the adipose tissue may drive liver fat accumulation. Ã‚Â© 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract       = {Background: Ultrasound and MR imaging are non-invasive methods that can be performed repeatedly and without discomfort. In the assessment of neuromuscular disorders it is unknown if they hold complementary information. In this study we tested this for patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). Methods: We performed quantitative muscle ultrasound (QMUS) and quantitative MRI (QMRI) of the legs in 5 men with FSHD. Results: The correlation between QMUS determined z-scores and QMRI determined muscle fraction and T1 signal intensity (SI) was very high. QMUS had a wider dynamic range than QMRI, whereas QMRI could detect inhomogeneous distribution of pathology over the length of the muscles. Discussion: Both QMUS and QMRI are well suited for imaging muscular dystrophy. The larger dynamic range of QMUS can be advantageous in follow-up of advanced disease stages, whereas QMRI seems preferable in pathologies such as FSHD that affect deep muscle layers and show inhomogeneous abnormality distributions.

Localized 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was performed in brain (cerebellum and thalamus/hippocampus) and in hind leg muscle of GAMT-/- mice before and after Cr supplementation and in control (Con) mice. As expected, a signal for Cr was hardly detectable in MR spectra of GAMT-/- mice before Cr supplementation. In the thalamus/hippocampus region of these mice, an increase in N-acetylasparate (NAA) was observed. During Cr administration, Cr levels increased faster in skeletal muscle compared with brain, but this occurred only during the first day of supplementation. Thereafter, Cr levels increased by 0.8 mM/day in all studied locations. After 35 days of Cr supplementation, Cr levels in all locations were higher compared with Con mice on a Cr-free diet and NAA levels normalized. Only because of the repeated MRS measurements performed in this longitudinal Cr supplementation study on GAMT-/- mice were we able to discover the initial faster uptake of Cr in skeletal muscle compared with brain, which may represent muscular Cr uptake independent of Cr transporter expression. Our results can provide the basis for additional experiments to optimize Cr supplementation in GAMT deficiency, as increases in brain Cr are slow in patients after Cr supplementation.},

Currently, it is unknown why specific muscles are affected before others and more particularly what pathophysiology is causing this differential progression. The aim of our study was to use a combination of (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) and T1-weighted MRI to uncover metabolic differences in fat infiltrated and not fat infiltrated muscles in patients with FSHD. T1-weighted images and 3D (31)P MRSI were obtained from the calf muscles of nine patients with diagnosed FSHD and nine healthy age and sex matched volunteers. Muscles of patients were classified as fat infiltrated (PFM) and non fat-infiltrated (PNM) based on visual assessment of the MR images. Ratios of phosphocreatine (PCr), phosphodiesters (PDE) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) over ATP and tissue pH were compared between PFM and PNM and the same muscles in healthy volunteers. Of all patients, seven showed moderate to severe fatty infiltration in one or more muscles. In these muscles, decreases in PCr/ATP and increases in tissue pH were observed compared to the same muscles in healthy volunteers. Interestingly, these differences were absent in the PNM group. Our data show that differences in metabolite ratios and tissue pH in skeletal muscle between healthy volunteers and patients with FSHD appear to be specific for fat infiltrated muscles. Normal appearing muscles on T1 weighted images of patients showed normal phosphoryl metabolism, which suggests that in FSHD disease progression is truly muscle specific.},

For practical considerations (dimensions of neonatal head) the measurements were performed on a cylindrical tissue-equivalent phantom (70 mm diameter of base material with mua = 0.01 mm(-1) (800 nm) and mu's = 1.00 mm(-1) (800 nm)), containing rods with 10 x absorption, or 10 x scattering, and 5 x both Monte Carlo simulations were carried out of a cylinder with transport scattering coefficient mu's = 0.525 mm(-1) and absorption coefficient mua = 0.075 mm(-1) and two optode positions.reproducibility of repeated measurements (n = 10) was +/- 0.005 OD. Maximum OD in case of absorbing rod, and of absorbing + scattering rod was measured with optodes separated by 90 degrees and rod position angle symmetrically (45 degrees ) in between. Minimum OD for these rods was obtained with optodes at 150 degrees angle and rod position at 240 degrees (i.e. relative to transmitting optode position at 0 degrees ). A second maximum OD was obtained at an optode angle 180 degrees and rod position at 180 degrees. Maximum OD (i.e. attenuation) for the scattering rod was at optode separation angle of 90 degrees and rod at 0 degrees. Minimum OD for this case was obtained with optode angle of 180 degrees and rod positions around 80 degrees and 280 degrees. Maximum OD changes by absorbing rod were in the order of +0.12 OD and -0.04 OD, respectively. Simulations at an optode separation angle of 90 degrees showed a spatial sensitivity path enclosing the rod position at maximum absorption found experimentally.when considering the phantom as a realistic geometrical model for the neonatal head, it can be concluded that the optode position at 90 degrees angle would be optimal for detecting an inhomogeneity at 15 mm depth, i.e. the location of the periventricular white matter. Since the rods are relatively strongly different from the base material the question remains to be answered whether local ischemia, which might lead to irreversible brain damage, can be detected by CW-NIRS},

Since the metabolism of 5-fluorouracil (5FU), a frequently used cytotoxic drug, is expected to be different in normal liver and in tumor tissue, spatial localization is required for detection by MRS. In this study, three independent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) optimizations were combined to enable chemical shift imaging (CSI) as a localization method in the detection of 5FU and its metabolites in tumor tissue. First, the hardware was optimized by using circularly polarized coils together with integrated preamplifiers. Second, the optimal pulse angle (Ernst angle) was determined on the basis of T(1) relaxation time measurements of 5FU. Finally, averaging of CSI phase-encoding steps was optimized by using the applied Hamming filter as a weighting function. The combination of these three methods enables the in vivo detection of 5FU and alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine (FBAL) by (19)F MRS, localized in three dimensions in tumor and liver tissue at a time resolution of 4 min at 1.5 Tesla.},

  abstract       = {Radioimmunotherapy using radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) directed against tumor-associated antigens might be an effective treatment modality for small volume disease. Our aim was to optimize an experimental model of radioimmunotherapy for small peritoneal metastases of colorectal origin using the anti-CEA MoAb MN-14. In nude mice with intraperitoneal (i.p.) LS174T tumors, a protein dose-escalation study was carried out to determine the maximal dose of radioiodinated MN-14 to be used in radioimmunotherapy. The biodistribution of radioiodinated MN-14 was determined after intravenous (i.v.) and i.p. administration. Finally, the therapeutic efficacy of escalating activity doses of (131)I-labeled MN-14 (62.5-500 microCi) was assessed and compared to that of unlabeled MN-14 or 500 microCi of (131)I-labeled irrelevant control antibody. At protein doses higher than 25 microg, uptake in tumor was reduced, presumably due to saturation of tumor antigen. During the first 24 hours i.p. administration led to higher tumor uptake and higher tumor:blood ratios than i.v. administration. Median survival of the control groups was 38 days (unlabeled MN-14) and 52 days ((131)I-labeled nonspecific antibody). Median survival of the groups treated with increasing activity doses of (131)I-labeled MN-14 was 42 days (62.5 microCi), 49 days (125 microCi), 63 days (250 microCi) and 101 days (500 microCi), respectively (p < 0.0001 compared to unlabeled MN-14). The present study shows that the anti-CEA-antibody MN-14 preferentially accumulates in i.p. LS174T tumor xenografts after both i.p. and i.v. administration. Intraperitoneal radioimmunotherapy using (131)I-labeled MN-14 delays significantly the outgrowth of peritoneal LS174T metastases, even at relatively low activity doses.},

Second, the influence of Parecoxib (1.0 or 5.0 mg/kg) on the biodistribution of 125I-MN-14 was assessed. Finally, the efficacy of RIT alone [125 microCi 131I-MN-14/mouse approximately 1/4 of the maximal tolerated dose (MTD)] was compared with that of Parecoxib monotherapy and RIT combined with daily injections of Parecoxib (1.0 or 5.0 mg/kg).Parecoxib had no measurable antitumor effect up to the highest dose level (25 mg/kg). Parecoxib had no effect on the uptake of 125I-MN-14 in the intraperitoneal tumor xenografts or on normal tissue distribution. Median survival of the control mice and the mice treated with Parecoxib monotherapy (1.0 or 5.0 mg/kg) was 48.5 days, 52 days and 52 days (P=0.47). RIT alone significantly delayed the growth of the intraperitoneal xenografts resulting in a median survival of 87 days (P<0.0001). Mice treated with RIT + Parecoxib at 1.0 or 5.0 mg/kg had a median survival of 73.5 days and 76 days, respectively, which was not statistically different from survival after RIT alone (P=0.15).The COX-2 inhibitor Parecoxib does not enhance the therapeutic efficacy of RIT of experimental small volume peritoneal carcinomatosis of colonic origin.},

  abstract  = {Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in the Western world. Therefore, detection and quantification of atherosclerotic disease is of paramount importance to monitor treatment and possible prevention of acute events. Vascular ultrasound is an excellent technique to assess the geometry of vessel walls and plaques. The high temporal as well as spatial resolution allows quantification of luminal area and plaque size and volume. While carotid arteries can be imaged non-invasively, scanning of coronary arteries requires invasive intravascular catheters. Both techniques have already demonstrated their clinical applicability. Using linear array technology, detection of disease as well as monitoring of pharmaceutical treatment in carotid arteries are feasible. Data acquired with intravascular ultrasound catheters have proved to be especially beneficial in understanding the development of atherosclerotic disease in coronary arteries. With the introduction of vascular elastography not only the geometry of plaques but also the risk for rupture of plaques might be identified. These so-called vulnerable plaques are frequently not flow-limiting and rupture of these plaques is responsible for the majority of cerebral and cardiac ischaemic events. Intravascular ultrasound elastography studies have demonstrated a high correlation between high strain and vulnerable plaque features, both ex vivo and in vivo. Additionally, pharmaceutical intervention could be monitored using this technique. Non-invasive vascular elastography has recently been developed for carotid applications by using compound scanning. Validation and initial clinical evaluation is currently being performed. Since abundance of vasa vasorum (VV) is correlated with vulnerable plaque development, quantification of VV might be a unique tool to even prevent this from happening. Using ultrasound contrast agents, it has been demonstrated that VV can be identified and quantified. Although far from routine clinical application, non-invasive and intravascular ultrasound VV imaging might pave the road to prevent atherosclerotic disease in an early phase. This paper reviews the conventional vascular ultrasound techniques as well as vascular ultrasound strain and vascular ultrasound VV imaging.},

Evidence of endocardial involvement on echocardiography is a major criterion, but sensitivity and specificity of echocardiography are not optimal. Here we investigated the utility of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) to diagnose infectious endocarditis in patients with gram-positive bacteraemia.Seventy-two patients with gram-positive bacteraemia were prospectively included. Patients with a positive blood culture growing Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus species or Enterococcus species were eligible when a risk factor for developing metastatic infectious foci was present. Infectious endocarditis was defined according to the revised Duke criteria. All patients underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT and echocardiography. (18)F-FDG uptake in or around the heart valves was evaluated independently by two nuclear medicine physicians.Sensitivity for diagnosing infectious endocarditis with (18)F-FDG PET/CT was 39\% and specificity was 93\%. The positive predictive value was 64\% and negative predictive value was 82\%. The mortality rate in patients without infectious endocarditis and without increased (18)F-FDG uptake in or around the heart valves was 18\%, and in patients without infectious endocarditis but with high (18)F-FDG uptake in or around the heart valves the mortality rate was 50\% (p = 0.181).(18)F-FDG PET/CT is currently not sufficiently adequate for the diagnosis of infectious endocarditis because of its low sensitivity. Improvements such as patient preparation with low carbohydrate-fat allowed diet and technical advances in the newest PET/CT scanners may increase sensitivity in future studies.},

  abstract       = {The prognosis of pancreatic cancer (PC) is highly dependent on the stage of the disease, and early recognition improves survival. Positron emission tomography (PET) using (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG) has been established as an important clinical tool for PC diagnosis, but it is not known whether FDG-PET detects premalignant stages of PC. We speculate that [(18)F]FDG uptake precedes the onset of PC in a hamster model. We used the N-nitrosobis(2-oxopropyl)amine (BOP) model, as these animals consistently develop PC within 20 weeks after first injection.Male Syrian hamsters were injected once a week with 10 mg BOP/kg body weight for 10 consecutive weeks. Terminal autopsy took place in groups of five hamsters from 4 weeks until 28 weeks after first BOP injection. After an 8-h fast, hamsters were injected with [(18)F]FDG and sacrificed 1 h after [(18)F]FDG injection. The pancreata were histopathologically examined, and the [(18)F]FDG uptake was determined and expressed as percentage of the injected dose per gram tissue (\%ID/g).Seven of 55 hamsters developed macroscopic signs of tumor. Histopathological examination revealed PC in 13 hamsters. [(18)F]FDG uptake increased gradually with time and was significantly higher in the group with PC compared to the group without PC.[(18)F]FDG accumulates preferentially in PC, and pancreata exposed to BOP showed a gradual increase in [(18)F]FDG accumulation.},

In a phase I/II clinical trail, [99mTc]P483H images were equivalent to those obtained with 111In ex vivo labeled leukocytes. However, there was physiologic accumulation of radioactivity in the body that could hamper interpretation of the images. In this study, the potential of [99mTc]P1827DS for infection imaging was assessed in comparison with [99mTc]P483H and the well-described imaging agent [99mTc] hydrazinonicotinamide (HYNIC)-interleukin 8 (IL-8).The binding of [99mTc]P1827DS to human blood cell was studied in vitro. A rabbit Escherichia coli infection model was used to perform the biodistribution and imaging studies with [99mTc]P1827DS, [99mTc]P483H and [99mTc]HYNIC-IL-8.[99mTc]P1827DS binds to leukocytes but not to erythrocytes. The leukocyte binding was not saturable up to an investigated concentration of 10 microM. The accumulation of [99mTc]P1827/DS at the infection site strongly depends on the P1827/DS ratio and was optimal at a molar ratio of 10:1. [99mTc]P1827DS shows improved biodistribution over [99mTc]P483H with similar uptake at the infection site. Abscess uptake of [99mTc]HYNIC-IL-8 was approximately three times higher than that of [99mTc]P1827DS. [99mTc]HYNIC-IL-8 showed high accumulation in the kidneys, whereas [99mTc]P1827DS showed high lung uptake and slightly higher accumulation in the liver and spleen.[99mTc]P1827DS is a potential new inflammation imaging agent, which clearly visualized the abscess in the rabbit E. coli infection model and showed improved biodistribution compared to [99mTc]P483H. However, the infection uptake and biodistribution of [99mTc]P1827DS is not superior to that of [99mTc]HYNIC-IL-8 in this animal model.},

Breathing of carbogen (95\% O2 and 5\% CO2) may increase the uptake of FU through changes in tumor physiology. This study aims to monitor in animal models in vivo the effects of carbogen breathing on tumor blood plasma volume, pH, and energy status, and on FU uptake and metabolism in two colon tumor models C38 and C26a, which differ in their vascular structure and hypoxic status. Phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to assess tumor pH and energy status, and fluorine-19 MRS was used to follow FU uptake and metabolism. Advanced magnetic resonance imaging methods using ultrasmall particles of iron oxide were performed to assess blood plasma volume. The results showed that carbogen breathing significantly decreased extracellular pH and increased tumor blood plasma volume and FU uptake in tumors. These effects were most significant in the C38 tumor line, which has the largest relative vascular area. In the C26a tumor line, carbogen breathing increased tumor growth delay by FU. In this study, carbogen breathing also enhanced systemic toxicity by FU.},

  abstract       = {Cholecystokinin 2 (CCK-2) receptor overexpression has been demonstrated in various tumours such as medullary thyroid carcinomas and small-cell lung cancers. Due to this high expression, CCK-2 receptors might be suitable targets for radionuclide imaging and/or radionuclide therapy. Several CCK-2 receptor-binding radiopeptides have been developed and some have been tested in patients. Here we aimed to compare the in vivo tumour targeting properties of 12 (111)In-labelled 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA)-conjugated gastrin/CCK2 receptor-binding peptides.Two CCK8-based peptides and ten gastrin-based peptide analogues were tested. All peptides were conjugated with DOTA and labelled with (111)In. Biodistribution studies were performed in mice with subcutaneous CCK2/gastrin receptor-expressing tumours and with receptor-negative tumours contralaterally. Biodistribution was studied by counting dissected tissues at 1 and 4 h after injection.Both the CCK analogues displayed relatively low tumour uptake (approximately 2.5\%ID/g) as compared to minigastrin analogues. Two linear minigastrin peptides (MG0 and sargastrin) displayed moderate tumour uptake at both 1 and 4 h after injection, but also very high kidney uptake (both higher than 48\%ID/g). The linear MG11, lacking the penta-Glu sequence, showed lower tumour uptake and also low kidney uptake. Varying the N-terminal Glu residues in the minigastrin analogues led to improved tumour targeting properties, with PP-F11 displaying the optimal biodistribution. Besides the monomeric linear peptides, a cyclized peptide and a divalent peptide were tested.Based on these studies, optimal peptides for peptide receptor radionuclide targeting of CCK2/gastrin receptor-expressing tumours were the linear minigastrin analogue with six D-Glu residues (PP-F11), the divalent analogue MGD5 and the cyclic peptide cyclo-MG1. These peptides combined high tumour uptake with low kidney retention, and may therefore be good candidates for future clinical studies.},

The (111)In-labelled somatostatin analogue octreotide (OctreoScan) is the most successful radiopeptide for tumour imaging, and was the first to be approved for diagnostic use. Based on the success of these studies, other receptor-targeting peptides such as cholecystokinin/gastrin analogues, glucagon-like peptide-1, bombesin (BN), chemokine receptor CXCR4 targeting peptides, and RGD peptides are currently under development or undergoing clinical trials.

Here, we present a further optimization of the (18)F labeling of NOTA-octreotide (IMP466). Octreotide was conjugated with the NOTA chelate and was labeled with (18)F in a two-step, one-pot method. The labeling procedure was optimized with regard to the labeling buffer, ionic strength, peptide concentration, and temperature. Radiochemical yield, specific activity, in vitro stability, and receptor affinity were determined. Biodistribution of (18)F-IMP466 was studied in AR42J tumor-bearing mice. In addition, microPET/CT images were acquired. IMP466 was labeled with Al(18)F in a single step with 97\% yield in the presence of 80\% (v/v) acetonitrile or ethanol. The labeled product was purified by HPLC to remove unlabeled peptide and unbound Al(18)F. The radiolabeling, including purification, was performed for 45 min. Specific activities of 48,000 GBq/mmol could be obtained. (18)F-IMP466 showed a high tumor uptake and excellent tumor-to-blood ratios at 2 h post-injection. In addition, the low bone uptake indicated that the Al(18)F-NOTA complex was stable in vivo. PET/CT scans revealed excellent tumor delineation and specific accumulation in the tumor. Uptake in receptor-negative organs was low. NOTA-octreotide could be labeled with (18)F in quantitative yields using a rapid two-step, one-pot, method. The compound was stable in vivo and showed rapid accretion in SSTR(2)-receptor-expressing AR42J tumors in nude mice. This method can be used to label other NOTA-conjugated compounds such as RGD peptides, GRPR-binding peptides, and Affibody molecules with (18)F.},

Overexpression of recombinant vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) by such xenografts induced functional and morphologic alterations of preexisting vessels. We now describe the effects of VEGF-A expression on visualization of these brain tumors in mice by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), using gadolinium diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid (Gd-DTPA) and ultra small paramagnetic iron oxide particles (USPIO) as contrast agents. Brain lesions derived from (mock-transfected) Mel57 cells were undetectable in MRI after Gd-DTPA injection. However, the majority of such lesions became visible after injection of USPIO, due to the lower vascular density in the lesions as compared to the surrounding parenchyma. In contrast, VEGF-A-expressing lesions were visualized using Gd-DTPA-enhanced MRI by a rapid circumferential enhancement, due to leaky peritumoral vasculature. USPIO-enhanced MRI of these tumors corroborated the immunohistochemic finding that peritumorally located, highly irregular and dilated vessels were present, while intratumoral vessel density was low. Our study shows that VEGF-A is a key factor in imaging of brain neoplasms. Our data also demonstrate that, at least in brain, blood-pool agent-enhanced MRI may be a valuable diagnostic tool to detect malignancies that are not visible on Gd-DTPA-enhanced MRI. Furthermore, the involvement of VEGF-A in MRI visibility suggests that care must be taken with MRI-based evaluation of antiangiogenic therapy, as anti-VEGF treatment might revert a tumor to a co-opting phenotype, resulting in loss of contrast enhancement in MRI.},

Based on indirect evidence in previous studies we hypothesize that such agents are liberated gradually from the coating via a cell-mediated degradation. In the present study, we tested this hypothesis by investigating the release mechanism and its kinetics by use of a radiolabeled osteogenic agent (  I-BMP-2) under conditions in which native cell populations with a coating-degradative potential were either absent or present. The release of   I-BMP-2 was monitored for 5 weeks, either in vitro or after implantation at an ectopic (subcutaneous) site in rats in vivo. Only from implants that bore a coating-incorporated depot of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) was the agent released slowly and steadily over 5 weeks, that is, 50% of the loaded dose was liberated in vivo (5 to 10% weekly), as against 14.6% in vitro (less than 1% weekly). The coatings bearing an incorporated depot of BMP-2 underwent significant cell-mediated degradation, whereas under cell-free conditions no degradation occurred, and the spontaneous release of BMP-2 was negligible. Our findings confirm this carrier system to be a suitable vehicle for the sustained and cell-mediated delivery of BMP-2. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract       = {In this study, a new radio-frequency (RF)-based, three-dimensional (3-D) strain imaging technique is introduced and applied to 3-D full volume ultrasound data of the heart of healthy children. Continuing advances in performance of transducers for 3-D ultrasound imaging have boosted research on 3-D strain imaging. In general, speckle tracking techniques are used for strain imaging. RF-based strain imaging has the potential to yield better performance than speckle- based methods because of the availability of phase information but such a system output is commercially not available. Furthermore, the relatively low frame rate of 3-D ultrasound data has limited broad application of RF-based cardiac strain imaging. In this study, the previously reported two-dimensional (2-D) strain methodology was extended to the third dimension. Three-dimensional RF-data were acquired in 13 healthy children, in the age range of 6-15 years, at a relatively low frame rate of 38-51 Hz. A 3-D, free-shape, coarse-to-fine displacement and strain estimation algorithm was applied to the RF-data. The heart was segmented using 3-D ellipsoid fitting. Strain was estimated in the radial (R), circumferential (C) and longitudinal directions (L). Our preliminary results reveal the applicability of the 3-D strain estimation technique on full volume 3-D RF-data. The technique enabled 3-D strain imaging of all three strain components. The average strains for all children were in the lateral wall R = 37 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 10\% (infero-lateral) and R = 32\% Ã¯Â¿Â½ 10\% (antero-lateral), C = -9\% Ã¯Â¿Â½ 4\% (antero-lateral) and C = -9\% Ã¯Â¿Â½ 4\% (infero-lateral), L = -18\% Ã¯Â¿Â½ 6 \% (antero-lateral) and L = -15\% Ã¯Â¿Â½ 4\% (infero-lateral). In the septum, strains were found to be R = 24\% Ã¯Â¿Â½ 10\% (antero-septal) and R = 13\% Ã¯Â¿Â½ 5\% (infero-septal), C = -13\% Ã¯Â¿Â½ 5\% (antero-septal) and -13\% Ã¯Â¿Â½ 5\% (infero-septal) and L = -13\% Ã¯Â¿Â½ 3\% (antero-septal) and L = -16\% Ã¯Â¿Â½ 5\% (infero-septal). Strain in the anterior and inferior walls seemed underestimated, probably caused by the low (in-plane) resolution and poor image quality. The field-of-view as well as image quality were not always sufficient to image the entire left ventricle. It is concluded that 3-D strain imaging using RF-data is feasible, but validation with other modalities and with conventional 3-D speckle tracking techniques will be necessary.},

  abstract       = {Computed diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (cDWI) refers to the synthesizing of arbitrary b value diffusion-weighted images (DWI) from a set of measured b value images by voxelwise fitting. The objectives of this study were to quantitatively analyze the noise and the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in cDWI as a function of b value by numerical simulations and by measurements in patients with prostate cancer and to compare cDWI to directly measured DWI at a b value of 1400 s/mm.Numerical simulations were performed to assess image noise and CNR in both cDWI and regular DWI. Forty-two patients with prostate cancer (age, 51-73 years; prostate specific antigen level, 0.5-30 ng/mL; and biopsy Gleason score, 6-9) received 2 DWI examinations at 3.0 T (one with b values of 100, 500, and 1400 s/mm and another with b values of 0, 100, 400, and 800 s/mm) to create cDWI images at arbitrary b values, both with and without incorporating a b value of 0 s/mm in their calculation. Regions of interest were drawn to compare the scan time adjusted CNR (CNReff) between cDWI and directly measured DWI at b = 1400 s/mm on tumor-suspicious lesions and normal-appearing regions.In the numerical simulations, noise depended strongly on the b value, the diffusion coefficient, and the signal intensity at a b value of 0 s/mm in cDWI but not in regular DWI. The CNR between simulated tumor and normal regions showed a continuous increase with increasing b value. Both these findings were also observed in tumor-suspicious and normal-appearing regions in in vivo data. In vivo prostate DWI at a b value of 1400 s/mm showed a similar CNReff between the tumor-suspicious regions and the normal-appearing tissue in cDWI as in the directly measured DWI (P = 0.395).The CNReff between tumor-suspicious and normal-appearing prostate tissue in DWI images at a b value of 1400 s/mm is comparable in cDWI and directly measured DWI. Computed DWI at even higher b values, calculated from measured images with b values between 0 and 800 s/mm, yields higher CNReff than measured DWI, which may be of clinical aid in the management of prostate cancer.},

  abstract       = {Statins may increase extracellular adenosine formation from adenosine monophosphate by enhancing ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity. This theory was tested in humans using dipyridamole-induced vasodilation as a read-out for local adenosine formation. Dipyridamole inhibits the transport of extracellular adenosine into the cytosol resulting in increased extracellular adenosine and subsequent vasodilation. In addition, we studied the effect of statin therapy in a forearm model of ischemia-reperfusion injury.Volunteers randomly received rosuvastatin or placebo in a double-blind parallel design (n=21). The forearm vasodilator response to intraarterial dipyridamole was determined in the absence and presence of the adenosine antagonist caffeine. During a separate visit the vasodilator response to nitroprusside and adenosine was established. In addition, healthy men were randomly divided in 3 groups to receive either placebo (n=10), rosuvastatin (n=22), or rosuvastatin combined with intravenous caffeine (n=12). Subsequently, volunteers performed forearm ischemic exercise. At reperfusion, Tc-99m-labeled annexin A5 was infused intravenously and scintigraphic images were acquired, providing an early marker of cell injury. Rosuvastatin treatment significantly increased the vasodilator response to dipyridamole, which was prevented by caffeine. Rosuvastatin did not influence the response to either sodium nitroprusside or adenosine indicating a specific interaction between rosuvastatin and dipyridamole, which does not result from an effect of rosuvastatin on adenosine clearance nor adenosine-receptor affinity or efficacy. Rosuvastatin increased tolerance to ischemia-reperfusion injury, which was attenuated by caffeine.Rosuvastatin increases extracellular adenosine formation, which provides protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury in humans in vivo. Therefore, statins and dipyridamole may interact synergistically.},

This may result from unopposed angiotensin II type 2 receptor stimulation, which is associated with enhanced apoptotic cell death and increased infarct size. We studied whether the clinical effectiveness of irbesartan is hampered by enhanced apoptotic activity, detected by exposition of phosphatidylserines, during ischemia and reperfusion in humans in vivo. Twenty healthy male volunteers were randomized to a 1-week treatment with irbesartan (300 mg/d) or placebo in a double-blind fashion. After treatment, all participants underwent 10 minutes of ischemic exercise of the nondominant forearm. Upon reperfusion, Tc-99m-labeled Annexin A5 was administered, and 1 and 4 hours afterward, both hands were scanned using a gamma camera. Targeting of annexin A5, expressed as the percentage difference in radioactivity in the area of interest (thenar muscle) between experimental and control hand, did not differ between participants treated with irbesartan or placebo. Therefore, irbesartan does not enhance phosphatidylserine exposition in humans in vivo. The results of this study do not support enhanced apoptotic activity after treatment with irbesartan in a setting of ischemia and reperfusion.},

  abstract       = {High kidney radiation doses during clinical peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with ÃŽÂ²-particle-emitting radiolabeled somatostatin analogs will lead to renal failure several months after treatment, urging the coinfusion of the cationic amino acids lysine and arginine to reduce the renal radiation dose. In rat PRRT studies, renal protection by the coadministration of lysine was confirmed by histologic examination of kidney specimens indicating nephrotoxicity. In the current study, we investigated dedicated small-animal SPECT/CT renal imaging in rats to monitor renal function in vivo during follow-up of PRRT, with and without lysine.The following 3 groups of rats were imaged using a multipinhole SPECT/CT camera: controls (group 1) and rats at more than 90 d after therapy with 460 MBq (15 ÃŽÂ¼g) of (177)Lu-DOTA-Tyr(3)-octreotate without (group 2) or with (group 3) a 400-mg/kg lysine coinjection as kidney protection (n Ã¢â€°Â¥ 6 per group). At 90 and 140 d after therapy, static kidney scintigraphy was performed at 2 h after injection of 25 MBq of (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA). In addition, dynamic dual-isotope renography was performed using 50 MBq of (111)In-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid ((111)In-DTPA) and 50 MBq of (99m)Tc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine ((99m)Tc-MAG3) at 100-120 d after therapy.(111)In-DTPA and (99m)Tc-MAG3 studies revealed a time-activity pattern comparable to those in patients, with a peak at 2-6 min followed by a decline of renal radioactivity. Reduced (111)In-DTPA, (99m)Tc-MAG3, and (99m)Tc-DMSA uptake indicated renal damage in group 2, whereas group 3 showed only a decrease of (99m)Tc-MAG3 peak activity. These results indicating nephrotoxicity in group 2 and renal protection in group 3 correlated with levels of urinary protein and serum creatinine and urea and were confirmed by renal histology.Quantitative dynamic dual-isotope imaging using both (111)In-DTPA and (99m)Tc-MAG3 and static (99m)Tc-DMSA imaging in rats is feasible using small-animal SPECT, enabling longitudinal monitoring of renal function. (99m)Tc-MAG3 renography, especially, appears to be a more sensitive marker of tubular function after PRRT than serum chemistry or (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy.},

The effect on paw inflammation scores during the weeks after treatment was evaluated. Liposome biodistribution and joint localization were investigated by labeling the preparation with radioactive (111)In-oxine. By studying PLP encapsulated in other types of liposomes, which show a distinctive tissue distribution pattern and reduced accumulation in inflamed joints, the importance of targeted delivery to inflamed joints for achieving an increased therapeutic effect was illustrated.Liposomal PLP proved to be highly effective in the rat AIA model. A single injection of 10 mg/kg resulted in complete remission of the inflammatory response for almost a week. In contrast, the same dose of unencapsulated PLP did not reduce inflammation, and only a slight effect was observed after repeated daily injections. Evidence was found that preferential glucocorticoid delivery to the inflamed joint was the key factor explaining the observed strong therapeutic benefit obtained with the liposomal preparation, while other possible mechanisms, such as splenic accumulation or prolonged release of prednisolone in the circulation, were excluded.Targeted delivery using long-circulating liposomes is a promising, novel means to successfully intervene in arthritis with glucocorticoid therapy.},

To investigate the potential of RIT with lutetium 177 (177Lu)-labeled G250, we conducted a protein dose escalation study and subsequently an RIT study in mice with intraperitoneally growing ccRCC lesions. Mice with intraperitoneal xenografts were injected with 1, 3, 10, 30, or 100 ÃŽÂ¼g of G250 labeled with 10 MBq indium 111 (111In) to determine the optimal protein dose. The optimal protein dose determined with imaging and biodistribution studies was used in a subsequent RIT experiment in three groups of 10 mice with intraperitoneal SK-RC-52 tumors. One group received 13 MBq 177Lu-DOTA-G250, a control group received 13 MBq nonspecific 177Lu-MOPC21, and the second control group was not treated and received 20 MBq 111In-DOTA-G250. The optimal G250 protein dose to target ccRCC in this model was 10 ÃŽÂ¼g G250. Treatment with 13 MBq 177Lu-DOTA-G250 was well tolerated and resulted in significantly prolonged median survival (139 days) compared to controls (49-53 days, p Ã¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å  .015), indicating that RIT has potential in this metastatic ccRCC model.},

  abstract    = {Tumor targeted optical imaging using antibodies labeled with near infrared fluorophores is a sensitive imaging modality that might be used during surgery to assure complete removal of malignant tissue. We evaluated the feasibility of dual modality imaging and image guided surgery with the dual labeled anti-carbonic anhydrase IX antibody preparation (111)In-DTPA-G250-IRDye800CW in mice with intraperitoneal clear cell renal cell carcinoma.BALB/c nu/nu mice with intraperitoneal SK-RC-52 lesions received 10 ÃŽÂ¼g DTPA-G250-IRDye800CW labeled with 15 MBq (111)In or 10 ÃŽÂ¼g of the dual labeled irrelevant control antibody NUH-82 (20 mice each). To evaluate when tumors could be detected, 4 mice per group were imaged weekly during 5 weeks with single photon emission computerized tomography/computerized tomography and the fluorescence imaging followed by ex vivo biodistribution studies.As early as 1 week after tumor cell inoculation single photon emission computerized tomography and fluorescence images showed clear delineation of intraperitoneal clear cell renal cell carcinoma with good concordance between single photon emission computerized tomography/computerized tomography and fluorescence images. The high and specific accumulation of the dual labeled antibody conjugate in tumors was confirmed in the biodistribution studies. Maximum tumor uptake was observed 1 week after inoculation (mean Ã‚Â± SD 58.5\% Ã‚Â± 18.7\% vs 5.6\% Ã‚Â± 2.3\% injected dose per gm for DTPA-G250-IRDye800CW vs NUH-82, respectively). High tumor uptake was also observed at other time points.This study demonstrates the feasibility of dual modality imaging with dual labeled antibody (111)In-DTPA-G250-IRDye800CW in a clear cell renal cell carcinoma model. Results indicate that preoperative and intraoperative detection of carbonic anhydrase IX expressing tumors, positive resection margins and metastasis might be feasible with this approach.},

  abstract       = {A study was performed to find and test quantitative methods of analysing echographic signals for the differentiation of diffuse liver diseases. An on-line data acquisition system was used to acquire radiofrequency (RF) echo signals from volunteers and patients. Several methods to estimate the frequency-dependent attenuation coefficient were evaluated, in which a correction for the frequency and depth-dependent diffraction and focusing effects caused by the sound beam was applied. Using the estimated value of the attenuation coefficient the RF signals themselves were corrected to remove the depth dependencies caused by the sound beam and by the frequency-dependent attenuation. After this preprocessing the envelope of the corrected RF signals was calculated and B-mode images were reconstructed. The texture was analysed in the axial direction by first- and second-order statistical methods. The accuracy and precision of the attenuation methods were assessed by using computer simulated RF signals and RF data obtained from a tissue-mimicking phantom. The phantom measurements were also used to test the performance of the methods to correct for the depth dependencies. The echograms of 163 persons, both volunteers and patients suffering from a diffuse liver disease (cirrhosis, hepatitis, haemochromatosis), were recorded. The mutual correlations between the estimated parameters were used to preselect parameters contributing independent information, and which can subsequently be used in a discriminant analysis to differentiate between the various diseased conditions.},

  abstract       = {MRSI provides MR spectra from multiple adjacent voxels within a body volume represented as a two- or three-dimensional matrix, allowing the measurement of the distribution of metabolites over this volume. The spectra of these voxels are usually analyzed one by one, without exploiting their spatial context. In this article, we present an advanced metabolite quantification method for MRSI data, in which the available spatial information is considered. A nonlinear least-squares algorithm is proposed in which prior knowledge is included in the form of proximity constraints on the spectral parameters within a grid and optimized starting values. A penalty term that promotes a spatially smooth spectral parameter map is added to the fitting algorithm. This method is adaptive, in the sense that several sweeps through the grid are performed and each solution may tune some hyperparameters at run-time. Simulation studies of MRSI data showed significantly improved metabolite estimates after the inclusion of spatial information. Improved metabolite maps were also demonstrated by applying the method to in vivo MRSI data. Overlapping peaks or peaks of compounds present at low concentration can be better quantified with the proposed method than with single-voxel approaches. The new approach compares favorably against the multivoxel approach embedded in the well-known quantification software LCModel. Copyright Ã¯Â¿Â½ 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract       = {Previous studies have shown that pretargeting allows rapid visualization of renal cell carcinomas (RCC) with an (111)In-labeled bivalent peptide. For radioimmunotherapy, a beta-emitting radionuclide labeled to a bivalent peptide is required. Therapeutic efficacy of these radionuclides depends on the E(max), physical half-life, and residence time of the radiolabel in the tumor. The (131)I radiolabel generally clears rapidly from the tumor after internalization and subsequent degradation of the bivalent l-amino acid peptide (l-a.a. peptide) in the tumor cells. To improve the residence time of the iodine label in the tumor, a new bivalent peptide was synthesized that is peptidase resistant and consists of 4 d-amino acids (d-a.a. peptide). Here we investigated the characteristics of the residualizing iodine label in SK-RC-52 RCC tumors.The d-a.a. peptide was manually synthesized according to standard solid-phase Fmoc/HBTU (2-[1H-benzotriazole-1-yl]-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate) chemistry. The uptake and retention in the tumor of (111)In-/(125)I-labeled bivalent peptides (l-a.a. peptide and d-a.a. peptide) were studied in female BALB/c athymic mice with subcutaneous SK-RC-52 RCC tumors. Tumors were pretargeted with the bispecific monoclonal antibody (bs-mAb) G250xDTIn-1 and, 72 h later, mice were injected intravenously with one of both radiolabeled peptides. The effect of bs-mAb-diDTPA-bs-mAb (DTPA is diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) bridging at the tumor cell surface on the internalization of the bs-mAb-diDTPA complex was investigated in SK-RC-52 tumor-bearing mice.The maximum uptake and retention of (125)I-labeled l-a.a. peptide in the tumor were significantly lower compared with that of the (111)In-labeled l-a.a. peptide. In contrast, the tumor uptake and retention of the (125)I-labeled d-a.a. peptide) were similar to that of the (111)In-labeled l-a.a. peptide but were superior at later time points. The biodistribution of the radioiodinated d-a.a. peptide was highly similar to that of the (111)In-labeled d-a.a. peptide, and both radiolabeled peptides were retained significantly better in the tumor than the (111)In-labeled l-a.a. peptide. bs-mAb-diDTPA-bs-mAb bridge formation did not affect internalization of the bs-mAb-diDTPA complex.Uptake and retention in the tumor of the iodinated peptide after pretargeting with a bs-mAb can be significantly improved using d-a.a. peptides. Accordingly, the radiation dose to the tumor, correlating with the therapeutic efficacy of pretargeted RCC, can be enhanced substantially.},

The stimulated echo enables the use of long observation times between the two pulsed field gradients that sample q-space completely. Propagators, constructed with long observation times, could discriminate slowly flowing protons from diffusing protons, as shown in a phantom in which a plug flow with linear velocity of 50microm/s could clearly be distinguished from stationary water. As a biological application the apparent diffusion constant in longitudinal direction of a transverse image of a maize plant stem had been measured as a function of observation time. Increasing contrast in the apparent diffusion constant image with increasing observation times were caused by differences in plant tissue: although the plant stem did not take up any water, the vascular bundles, concentrated in the outer ring of the stem, could still be discerned because of their longer unrestricted diffusional pathways for water in the longitudinal direction compared to cells in the parenchymal tissue. In the xylem region of a tomato pedicel flowing water could be distinguished from a large amount of stationary water. Linear flow velocities up to 0.67 mm/s were measured with an observation time of 180 ms.},

In this study, a bispecific anticarcinoembryonic antigen (CEACAM5; CD66e) Ãƒâ€�? antihapten monoclonal antibody, TF2, was used in combination with a small (1.5 kD) peptide, IMP288, labeled with (111)In and (177)Lu.First, tumor uptake of (111)In-IMP288 and (177)Lu-IMP288, as determined by immuno-SPECT, was validated by ex vivo counting. Two groups of female BALB/c nude mice had LS174T tumors implanted in the peritoneal cavity. They received intravenous injections of TF2, followed by 10 MBq of (111)In-IMP288 or 90 MBq of (177)Lu-IMP288. A control group of non-tumor-bearing mice received TF2 and (111)In-IMP288. One hour after the radiolabeled IMP288 was given, small-animal SPECT/CT images were acquired, and subsequently animals were dissected. Furthermore, a survival study was performed in 3 groups of 10 mice with intraperitoneal tumors: mice received TF2 and (177)Lu-IMP288 (60 MBq), nonpretargeted (177)Lu-IMP288 (60 MBq), or phosphate-buffered saline. Immuno-SPECT scans were acquired directly after therapy and at 14 and 45 d after therapy. Tumor growth was analyzed in the successive scans in each animal.(111)In- and (177)Lu-labeled IMP288 had similar in vivo distribution. The activity measured in the pretargeted immuno-SPECT images correlated well with the uptake measured in the dissected tumors (Pearson r = 0.99, P < 0.05). In the therapy study, the SPECT images showed rapid and selective tumor targeting with high tumor-to-background contrast (30 Ã‚Â± 12) as early as 1 h after injection. The successive images of the treated mice showed delayed tumor growth in the pretargeted radioimmunotherapy group, corresponding with their prolonged survival.Pretargeted immuno-SPECT with TF2 and (111)In- or (177)Lu-IMP288 can be used to predict and confirm tumor targeting and monitor the therapeutic effect of pretargeted radioimmunotherapy.},

FDG-PET had a higher sensitivity (53\% vs. 37\%) and positive predictive value (80\% vs. 75\%) than CT. The combination of CT and FDG-PET had the highest sensitivity (63\%). The ROC analyses of the five point ordinal scales revealed that the "area under the curve" (AUC) of FDG-PET was significantly higher as compared to CT.In HNSCC patients with risk factors, pretreatment screening for distant metastases by chest CT is improved by FDG-PET.},

  abstract       = {The use of (99m)Tc-ciprofloxacin as a tracer for infection and inflammation has been examined and discussed in the literature extensively. Its alleged ability to discriminate between sterile inflammation and bacterial versus nonbacterial infections has led to an intense debate. Other labeled fluoroquinolones might offer better characteristics or may add to a better understanding of the working mechanism of (99m)Tc-ciprofloxacin. The rationale of this work was to determine possible differences in the use of 2 labeled quinolones--that is, (99m)Tc-ciprofloxacin and (99m)Tc-enrofloxacin--as tracers for infection and inflammation in animals.Ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin were labeled with (99m)Tc and characterized. The stability of both preparations was evaluated in serum and in the presence of an excess of cysteine. In vitro binding studies were performed to determine the interaction of the labeled quinolones with bacteria and other cells. Rats with sterile and infectious intramuscular lesions were used to study the scintigraphic properties of the 2 compounds. To assess the specificity of binding to living bacteria, infectious intramuscular lesions of heat-killed Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans were used as controls. Imaging was performed with a gamma-camera at 0, 3, 5, and 22 h after injection.The radiochemical purity of both radiolabeled fluoroquinolones exceeded 95\% as determined by instant thin-layer chromatography. Both compounds were moderately stable in serum. Binding assays did not show any saturable binding to S. aureus, heat-killed S. aureus, as well as C. albicans. None of the tracers showed specific binding to bacteria. Scintigraphy showed uptake in the infectious lesion at 1 h after injection, which washed out during the next 4 h. Abscess-to-muscle ratios for both preparations were not significantly different for the various infectious or inflammatory lesions studied and did not exceed an average of 4.25 +/- 0.62.The study demonstrated that (99m)Tc-ciprofloxacin and (99m)Tc-enrofloxacin do not show preferential binding to living bacteria. In vivo (99m)Tc-enrofloxacin has similar characteristics as (99m)Tc-ciprofloxacin except for differences in uptake in a few normal tissues.},

  abstract    = {Cartesian k-space sampling in three-dimensional magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) of the prostate limits the selection of voxel size and acquisition time. Therefore, large prostates are often scanned at reduced spatial resolutions to stay within clinically acceptable measurement times. Here we present a semilocalized adiabatic selective refocusing (sLASER) sequence with gradient-modulated offset-independent adiabatic (GOIA) refocusing pulses and spiral k-space acquisition (GOIA-sLASER-Spiral) for fast prostate MRSI with enhanced resolution and extended matrix sizes.MR was performed at 3 tesla with an endorectal receive coil. GOIA-sLASER-Spiral at an echo time (TE) of 90 ms was compared to a point-resolved spectroscopy sequence (PRESS) with weighted, elliptical phase encoding at an TE of 145 ms using simulations and measurements of phantoms and patients (n?=?9).GOIA-sLASER-Spiral acquisition allows prostate MR spectra to be obtained in ?5?min with a quality comparable to those acquired with a common Cartesian PRESS protocol in ?9?min, or at an enhanced spatial resolution showing more precise tissue allocation of metabolites. Extended field of views (FOVs) and matrix sizes for large prostates are possible without compromising spatial resolution or measurement time.The flexibility of spiral sampling enables prostate MRSI with a wide range of resolutions and FOVs without undesirable increases in acquisition times, as in Cartesian encoding. This approach is suitable for routine clinical exams of prostate metabolites. Magn Reson Med, 2016. Ã¯Â¿Â½ 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract       = {Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is a multi-step process regulated by pro- and anti-angiogenic factors. In order to grow and metastasize, tumors need a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients. For their growth beyond the size of 1-2 mm tumors are dependent on angiogenesis. Recently, various new anti-cancer agents (e.g. bevacizumab, sorafenib and sunitinib) have become available that specifically inhibit angiogenesis in tumors. To evaluate the effects of these new anti-angiogenic agents it would be of interest to scintigraphically image the process of angiogenesis in tumors. Several markers have been described that are preferentially expressed on newly formed blood vessels in tumors (alpha(v)beta(3) integrin, vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptor, prostate-specific membrane antigen) and in the extracellular matrix surrounding newly formed blood vessels (extra-domain B of fibronectin, Tenascin-C, matrix metalloproteinases, Robo-4). Several ligands targeting these markers have been tested as a radiotracer for imaging angiogenesis in tumors. The potential of some of these tracers such as radiolabeled cyclic RGD peptides and radiolabeled anti-PSMA antibodies has already been tested cancer patients, while for markers such as Robo-4 the ligand has not yet been identified. Here the preclinical and clinical studies with these new tracers to image angiogenesis in tumors are reviewed.},

The images directly reflect the spatially resolved phosphorus content of mineral tissue in dentin and enamel; they show a lack of signal from pulp tissue and reduced signal from de-mineralized carious lesions. We demonstrate for the first time that the signal in (31)P MR images of mineralized tissue is enhanced by a (1)H-(31)P nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE). Using teeth as a model for imaging mineralized human tissue, graded differences in signal enhancement are observed that correlate well with known mineral content. From solid-state NMR experiments we conclude that the NOE is facilitated by spin diffusion and that the NOE difference can be assigned to a higher water content and a different micro-structure of dentin. Thus, a novel method for imaging mineral content without ionizing radiation is proposed. This method has potential use in the assessment of de-mineralization states in humans, such as caries of teeth and osteoporosis of bones.},

The aim of this study was to assess postoperative FDG uptake in colorectal anastomosis in patients without suspicion of active infection or anastomotic leakage.Design of a prospective observational pilot study in order to assess normal FDG uptake in the patient anastomosis after colorectal surgery. Patients that underwent colorectal surgery with primary anastomosis received FDG-PET of the abdomen, 2-6 days postoperatively.35 patients met the inclusion criteria. Three patients were not scanned for various reasons. Of the remaining 32 patients, one demonstrated an increased uptake of FDG at the site of the anastomosis. In the other 31 patients FDG uptake was negligible (n = 17) or scored as physiological (n = 14). None of the scanned patients developed a clinical relevant anastomotic leakage within the first 30 days after surgery.The present study shows that FDG uptake in colorectal anastomosis remains low within the first six days after surgery in patients without anastomotic leakage. Therefore, FDG-PET might be useful to investigate further as a tool to detect anastomotic leakage in an the early postoperative phase.},

In the studies presented here, (111)In-RGD2 was assessed for its potential as an imaging tool to monitor such responses to therapies.DOTA-E-[c(RGDfK)]2 was radiolabeled with (111)In ((111)In-RGD2), and biodistribution studies were performed in mice with subcutaneous FaDu or SK-RC-52 xenografts after treatment with either antiangiogenic therapy (bevacizumab or sorafenib) or tumor irradiation (10 Gy). Micro-SPECT imaging studies and subsequent quantitative analysis were also performed. The effect of bevacizumab, sorafenib, or radiation therapy on tumor growth was determined.The uptake of (111)In-RGD2 in tumors, as determined from biodistribution studies, correlated well with that quantified from micro-SPECT images, and both showed that 15 d after irradiation (111)In-RGD2 uptake was enhanced. Specific or nonspecific uptake of (111)In-RGD2 in FaDu or SK-RC-52 xenografts was not affected after antiangiogenic therapy, except in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma 19 d after the start of sorafenib therapy (P < 0.05). The uptake of (111)In-RGD2 followed tumor volume in studies featuring antiangiogenic therapy. However, the uptake of (111)In-RGD2 in FaDu xenografts was decreased as early as 4 h after tumor irradiation, despite nonspecific uptake remaining unaltered. Tumor growth was inhibited after antiangiogenic or radiation therapy.Here, it is suggested that (111)In-RGD2 could allow in vivo monitoring of angiogenic responses after radiotherapy and may therefore prove a good clinical tool to monitor angiogenic responses early after the start of radiotherapy in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Despite clear antitumor efficacy, antiangiogenic therapy did not alter tumor uptake of (111)In-RGD2, indicating that integrin expression was not altered.},

Positron emission tomography (PET) using the tracer [(18)F]fluoromisonidazole ([(18)F]FMISO) is most frequently used for non-invasive evaluation of hypoxia in human tumours. A series of ten human head and neck xenograft tumour lines was used to validate [(18)F]FMISO as hypoxia marker at the microregional level.Autoradiography after injection of [(18)F]FMISO was compared with immunohistochemical staining for the hypoxic cell marker pimonidazole in the same tumour sections of ten different human head and neck xenograft tumour lines. The methods were compared: first, qualitatively considering the microarchitecture; second, by obtaining a pixel-by-pixel correlation of both markers at the microregional level; third, by measuring the signal intensity of both images; and fourth, by calculating the hypoxic fractions by pimonidazole labelling.The pattern of [(18)F]FMISO signal was dependent on the distribution of hypoxia at the microregional level. The comparison of [(18)F]FMISO autoradiography and pimonidazole immunohistochemistry by pixel-by-pixel analysis revealed moderate correlations. In five tumour lines, a significant correlation between the mean [(18)F]FMISO and pimonidazole signal intensity was found (range, r(2)=0.91 to r(2)=0.99). Comparison of the tumour lines with respect to the microregional distribution pattern of hypoxia revealed that the correlation between the mean signal intensities strongly depended on the microarchitecture. Overall, a weak but significant correlation between hypoxic fractions based on pimonidazole labeling and the mean [(18)F]FMISO signal intensity was observed (r(2)=0.18, p=0.02). For the three tumour models with a ribbon-like microregional distribution pattern of hypoxia, the correlation between the hypoxic fraction and the mean [(18)F]FMISO signal intensity was much stronger and more significant (r(2)=0.73, p<0.001) than for the tumours with a more homogenous, patchy, microregional distribution pattern of hypoxia.Different patterns of [(18)F]FMISO accumulation dependent on the underlying microregional distribution of hypoxia were found in ten head and neck xenograft tumours. A weak albeit significant correlation was found between the mean [(18)F]FMISO signal intensity and the hypoxic fraction of the tumours. In larger clinical tumours, [(18)F]FMISO-PET provides information on the tumour oxygenation status on a global level, facilitating dose painting in radiation treatment planning. However, caution must be taken when studying small tumour subvolumes as accumulation of the tracer depends on the presence of hypoxia and on the tumour microarchitecture.},

  abstract       = {Calcium phosphate cements (CPCs) are commonly used bone substitute materials, which closely resemble the composition of the mineral phase of bone. However, this high similarity to natural bone also results in difficult discrimination from the bone tissue by common imaging modalities, that is, plain X-ray radiography and three-dimensional computed tomography (CT). In addition, new imaging techniques introduced for bone tissue visualization, like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), face a similar problem. Even at high MRI resolution, the lack of contrast between CPCs and surrounding bone is evident. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a dual contrast agent, traceable with both CT and MRI as enhancers of CPC/bone tissue contrast. Our formulation is based on the use of silica beads as vectors, which encapsulate and carry contrast-enhancing nanoparticles, in our case, colloidal Gold and Superparamagnetic Iron oxide particles (SPIO). The bead suspension was incorporated within a calcium phosphate powder. The resultant cements were then tested both in vitro and in vivo in a femoral condyle defect model in rats. Results showed that the mechanical properties of the cement were not significantly affected by the inclusion of the beads. Both in vitro and in vivo data proved the homogeneous incorporation of the contrast within the cement and its visual localization, characterized by a short-term CT contrast enhancement and a long-term MR effect recognizable by the characteristic blooming shape. Finally, no signs of adverse tissue reactions were noticed in vivo. In conclusion, this study proved the feasibility of a multimodal contrast agent as an inert and biocompatible enhancer of CaP cement versus bone tissue contrast.},

  abstract       = {Gram-positive bacteremia has a high morbidity and mortality rate of approximately 30\%. Delayed diagnosis of clinically silent metastatic infectious foci is an important indicator for a complicated outcome. (18)F-FDG PET/CT allows detection of focal infection, resulting in lower relapse rates and mortality. Here, we present a cost-effectiveness analysis associated with introduction of (18)F-FDG PET/CT for patients with gram-positive bacteremia.A cost-effectiveness analysis in a prospective (18)F-FDG PET/CT group (n = 115) and matched control group (n = 230) was performed alongside a clinical study, the results of which were previously published. Mortality at 6 mo was considered the final effect outcome and was used in the denominator of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.Mortality in the (18)F-FDG PET/CT group was 19\%, compared with 32\% in the control group (P < 0.01). Incremental costs of (18)F-FDG PET/CT were $9,454 (95\% confidence interval [CI], $3,963-$14,947), mainly because of admission (mean, $6,631; 95\% CI, $1,449-$11,814). Additional costs were related to echocardiography (P < 0.01), not to (18)F-FDG PET/CT (P = 0.8). The mean incremental costs of the (18)F-FDG PET/CT strategy estimated by stratification for endocarditis were $5,277 per patient (95\% CI, $429-$10,123; P = 0.03). The point estimate of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is $72,487 per prevented death (95\% CI, $11,388-$323,379).Introduction of a diagnostic regimen including routine (18)F-FDG PET/CT decreases morbidity and mortality. The cost increase is due to in-hospital treatment of metastatic infectious foci. Costs per prevented death, $72,487, are within the range that is considered to be efficient by Dutch guidelines. Patients with high-risk gram-positive bacteremia therefore should have easy access to (18)F-FDG PET/CT to enable early detection of metastatic infectious disease.},

  abstract       = {In this study, we examined the in vivo relationship between functional tumor vasculature, determined by dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE-) MRI, and tumor metabolism, determined by dynamic (18)F-FDG PET, during cytotoxic treatment of patients with colorectal liver metastases.Twenty-three patients underwent DCE-MRI (using gadolinium dimeglumine) and dynamic (18)F-FDG PET at baseline and after 3 treatment cycles, unless treatment was terminated because of toxicity. Parameters for vasculature (rate constant between extravascular extracellular space and blood plasma [k(ep)] and volume transfer constant [K(trans)]), extracellular space (v(e)), tumor size (the maximal axial diameter of each included lesion [MAD]), and metabolism (glucose metabolic rates [MR(glc)]) were derived, and changes during treatment were correlated. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) served as outcome measures for the predictive abilities of pretreatment parameters and of treatment-related parameter changes.Pretreatment MR(glc) and MAD were individually predictive for OS and PFS. During treatment, K(trans) increased significantly, but this increase could not be confirmed in a lesion-by-lesion analysis. MR(glc) decreased significantly (P < 0.001). No correlations were found for changes in DCE-MRI parameters and DeltaMR(glc). No relationship was found between changes in DCE-MRI parameters and OS or PFS. DeltaMR(glc) was able to predict OS (P = 0.008) after correction for confounders.The efficacy of cytotoxic chemotherapy assessed by reduction in tumor metabolism does not depend on pretreatment properties of the tumor vasculature determined by DCE-MRI. Cytotoxic chemotherapy does not alter DCE-MRI-derived properties of tumor vasculature but decreases glucose consumption of tumor cells.},

  abstract       = {The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that quantitative analysis of transcutaneous (Transc) ultrasound (US) images can predict the liver fat content with similar accuracy and precision as using intraoperative (Intraop) US. The second goal was to investigate if a tissue mimicking phantom (TMP) might be used as reference for automatic gain compensation (AGC) vs. depth instead of using the data of a set of cows without hepatic alterations. A study was performed in post partum dairy cows (N = 151), as an animal model of human nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), to test these hypotheses. Five Transc and five Intraop US liver images were acquired in each animal and a liver biopsy was taken. In liver tissue samples, triacylglycerol (TAG) content was measured by biochemical analysis and hepatic alterations, other than hepatic steatosis, were excluded by clinical examination. Several preprocessing steps were performed before the ultrasound tissue characteristics (UTC) parameters of B-mode images were derived. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was performed on a training set (N = 76) and the results were used on the test group (N = 75) to predict the TAG content in the liver. In all cases, the residual attenuation coefficient (ResAtt) was the only selected parameter. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was applied to assess the performance and area under the curve (AUC) of predicting TAG and to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the methods used. High ROC values for AUC (95\%), sensitivity (87\%) and specificity (83\%) for both Intraop and Transc applications with control group as well as with phantom-based AGC were obtained. Consequently, it can be concluded that Transc results are equivalent to Intraop results. Furthermore, equivalent ROC values, when using TMP AGC, indicates the potential use of TMP-based corrections instead of normal group-based corrections. The high predictive values indicate that noninvasive quantitative US has a great potential for staging and screening on hepatic steatosis in cows.},

In this study, we performed diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance imaging at ultra-high field in a mouse model for AD (APP(swe)/PS1(dE9)) in combination with a voxel-based approach and tractography to detect changes in water diffusivity in white and gray matter, because these reflect structural alterations in neural tissue. We found substantial changes in water diffusion parallel and perpendicular to axonal tracts in several white matter regions like corpus callosum and fimbria of the hippocampus, that match with previous findings of axonal disconnection and myelin degradation in AD patients. Moreover, we found a significant increase in diffusivity in specific hippocampal subregions, which is supported by neuronal loss as visualized with KlÃƒÂ¼ver-Barrera staining. This work demonstrates the potential of ultra-high field diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance imaging as a noninvasive modality to describe white and gray matter structural changes in mouse models for neurodegenerative disorders, and provides valuable knowledge to assess future AD prevention strategies in translational research.},

  abstract       = {We have tested the hypothesis that the type and kinetics of voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels in a neuroendocrine cell depend on the cell's long-term external input. For this purpose, the presence and kinetics of both low (LVA) and high-voltage-activated (HVA) L-type Ca(2+) channels have been assessed in melanotrope pituitary cells of the amphibian Xenopus laevis. The secretory activity of this cell type can readily be manipulated in vivo by changing the animal's environmental light condition, from a black to a white background. We here show that, compared to white background-adapted Xenopus, melanotropes from black background-adapted frogs have (1) a much larger size, as revealed by their 2.5 times larger membrane capacitance (P<0.001), (2) a 2 times higher HVA current density (P<0.05), (3) a clearly smaller Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation (10\%; P<0.05), (4) L-type channels with 5 times slower activation and inactivation kinetics (P<0.05), and (5) slower kinetics of L-type channels that become faster and more similar to those in white-background adapted cells when the intracellular Ca(2+)-buffering capacity is reduced. Furthermore, white-adapted melanotropes possess LVA-type Ca(2+) channels, which are lacking from cells from black-adapted animals. The melanotrope calmodulin mRNA level does not differ between the two adaptation states. These results indicate that HVA L-type channel kinetics differ in relation to environmentally induced changes in cellular secretory state, probably mediated via intracellular Ca(2+)-buffering, whereas the occurrence of LVA Ca(2+) channels may depend on environmentally controlled channel gene expression.},

  abstract    = {Ever since their discovery, liposomes have been radiolabeled to monitor their fate in vivo. Despite extensive preclinical studies, only a limited number of radiolabeled liposomal formulations have been examined in patients. Since they can play a crucial role in patient management, it is of importance to enable translation of radiolabeled liposomes into the clinic.Liposomes have demonstrated substantial advantages as drug delivery systems and can be efficiently radiolabeled. Potentially, radiolabeled drug-loaded liposomes form an elegant theranostic system, which can be tracked in vivo using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. In this review, we discuss important aspects of liposomal research with a focus on the use of radiolabeled liposomes and their potential role in drug delivery and monitoring therapeutic effects.Radiolabeled drug-loaded liposomes have been poorly investigated in patients and no radiolabeled liposomes have been approved for use in clinical practice. Evaluation of the risks, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and toxicity is necessary to meet pharmaceutical and commercial requirements. It remains to be demonstrated whether the results found in animal studies translate to humans before radiolabeled liposomes can be implemented into clinical practice.},

  url       = {http://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/92732},
  abstract  = {Chapter 1 of this thesis introduces Ca2+ signaling and the role of the Na+/Ca2+-exchanger (NCX) in Ca2+ homeostasis. It describes the general features of NCX function and regulation and indicates the importance of the Ca2+-binding domains (CBD1 and CBD2). The subsequent Chapters of this thesis present a detailed analysis of the CBDs using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and other biophysical techniques. Chapter 2 gives a general introduction of NMR as a tool to study proteins. Chapter 3 describes the structural and dynamical effects of Ca2+ binding to CBD2 and the results are compared between splice variants and other Ca2+-binding proteins. NCX1-CBD2-AD has two Ca2+ binding sites and the data show highly similar Ca2+ affinities for both sites, even though the primary site has six coordinating carboxylates and the secondary site only two, indicating positive cooperative binding. The 15N-relaxation data show that Ca2+ binding to CBD2 rigidifies not only loops near the Ca2+ binding sites but also in the FG-loop at the opposite site of the domain. This suggests that the Ca2+-binding event is felt throughout the molecule and implicates an import role for the FG- loop in connecting the Ca2+ binding event of CBD2 with other cytosolic domains of the NCX. Divalent cations, such as Mg2+, compete with Ca2+ for the Ca2+ binding sites. The Mg2+ concentration inside the cell is approximately a thousand times higher than the intracellular Ca 2+ concentration. Therefore, functional Ca2+ sensors must have binding sites highly specific for Ca2+. Chapter 4 shows that only one of the two binding sites of NCX1-CBD2-AD is specific for Ca2+. Mg2+ always occupies the other binding site and the Mg2+-bound NCX1-CBD2-AD is structurally more stable and has an altered Ca2+ affinity for the remaining binding site than apo NCX1-CBD2-AD. A solution structure of NCX3-CBD2-B in the Ca2+ bound form is presented in Chapter 5. This is the first structure of a domain of NCX3. The structure is highly homologous to NCX1-CBD2-AD. The new structure shows that the overall fold of CBD2, including the b-bulges and the a-helix, are conserved between the different NCX isoforms. The orientation of the a-helix with respect to the b-sandwich is determined for the first time using residual dipolar coupling measurements. The relevance of this orientation in the full-length exchanger is discussed. The Calx-b motif is compared to other motifs of the immunoglobulin fold in Chapter 6. A structural explanation is given for the distinct Ca2+ binding properties of the different CBD variants and a gives a short outlook on NCX research. Finally, Chapter 7 presents an overall summary of this thesis.},

  abstract   = {In this thesis, methods are described for automated analysis of 3D (pediatric) echographic images of the heart. Due to successful (surgical) treatment more and more patients with a congenital heart disease survive and reach adulthood. The demand for reliable, non-invasive, methods for diagnosis and regular monitoring of patients with a heart disease is therefore of great interest. In particular, in children with cardiac malformations regular monitoring of the cardiac function is of great importance. During the past decades, echocardiography has become an increasingly important imaging technique because of its high temporal resolution and non-invasiveness. The recent introduction of three dimensional (3D) ultrasound techniques facilitates accurate assessment of the exact geometry and deformation of the heart in three dimensions. The addition of this third dimension is very important for the diagnosis of children with a (congenital) heart disease since the precise determination of the geometry in 3D can be of eminent importance when abnormal cardiac anatomy is present. Since manual analysis of 3D ultrasound images is time-consuming and is sensitive to judgment differences between human experts, automated analysis of these images is desired. The objective of the research in this thesis is automated segmentation (to distinguish regions with different types of tissue) of 3D echocardiographic images without using a priori knowledge about the average shape of the heart.},
